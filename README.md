# Plant Identificationüå≥

## About

Plant Identifier is my personal project, designed to help identify plants step-by-step based on key features such as leaves, flowers, fruits, or locations like Great Walks. This approach allows me to learn the distinguishing features of plants within the same genus. The application provides detailed plant information on dedicated pages and includes images that can be zoomed in and out for close inspection of plant details.

## Tech Used üíª

* TypeScript
* React.js
* Tree component
* Image zoom-in/out

## Next Step ‚è≠Ô∏è

* Connect to database
* Collect data / Ask Gemini for data
* Add flower and fruit identification feature
* Identification on Great Walks

### Installation

#### **From the command line**

```
git clone git@github.com:bihui-sun/plant-identification.git
cd plant-identification
npm install # to install dependencies
npm run dev # to start the dev server
```

You can find the server running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and the client running on [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).
