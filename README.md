# Plant IdentificationðŸŒ³

## About

Plant Identifier is my personal project, designed to help identify plants step-by-step based on key features such as leaves, flowers, fruits, or locations like Great Walks. This approach allows me to learn the distinguishing features of plants within the same genus. The application provides detailed plant information on dedicated pages and includes images that can be zoomed in and out for close inspection of plant details.

## Setup

### What's included

This repo includes:

* a single, simple API endpoint (`/api/v1/fruits`)
* a single React component (`<App />`)
* an example database module (`server/db/fruits.js`)
* an API client module (`client/apis/fruits.js`)
* configuration for Vitest and testing library
* configuration for server-side debugging in VS Code
* configuration for preprocessing Sass
